;; Parallel execution utilities

(defn parallel-map
  "Map f over coll with at-most n concurrent operations; returns deferred of vector.

   This function partitions the collection into chunks of size n, processes each
   chunk concurrently, then combines results while preserving order.

   Features:
   - Preserves original collection order in results
   - Propagates earliest exception and cancels remaining operations
   - Memory-efficient for large collections
   - Configurable concurrency level

   Args:
     n - Maximum concurrent operations (default: 8)
     f - Function to map over collection elements
     coll - Collection to process
