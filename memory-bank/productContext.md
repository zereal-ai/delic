# Product Context: desic

## Why desic Exists

### The Problem
DSPy revolutionized LLM application development by replacing manual prompt engineering with systematic optimization. However, existing DSPy implementations are Python-only, creating integration challenges for JVM-based applications and requiring complex polyglot deployments.

### The Gap
Clojure's functional programming paradigm, immutable data structures, and powerful concurrency primitives make it an ideal language for reliable LLM pipelines. Yet no native Clojure implementation of DSPy's core concepts exists.

### The Solution
desic brings DSPy's systematic approach to Clojure, providing:
- **Programming over Prompting**: Write declarative code instead of crafting brittle prompt strings
- **Automatic Optimization**: Let algorithms find better parameters than manual tuning
- **JVM Native**: No Python interop, clean deployment, leverage existing JVM infrastructure

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience
```clojure
;; 1. Define what you want (signature)
(defsignature QA (question => answer))

;; 2. Build your pipeline (composition)
(defn rag-pipeline [question]
  (-> question
      retrieve-relevant-docs
      (generate-answer :sig QA)))

;; 3. Let desic optimize it (automation)
(def optimized-pipeline
  (optimize rag-pipeline training-data exact-match))

;; 4. Deploy and run (production)
(optimized-pipeline "What is machine learning?")
```

### Key User Journeys

#### Journey 1: Rapid Prototyping
1. Developer defines signatures for their use case
2. Composes a basic pipeline using built-in modules
3. Tests interactively in REPL with Portal visualization
4. Iterates quickly without leaving Clojure environment

#### Journey 2: Production Optimization
1. Team has working prototype pipeline
2. Runs optimization against curated training dataset
3. System automatically finds better prompt/parameter combinations
4. Deploys optimized pipeline as single uberjar

#### Journey 3: Live Monitoring
1. Production pipeline runs with Portal integration
2. Real-time visibility into module execution and performance
3. Easy debugging when LLM behavior changes
4. Metrics collection for further optimization
